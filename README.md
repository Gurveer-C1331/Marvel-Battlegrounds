# Marvel-Battlegrounds
The Marvel Battlegrounds game is a Pok√©mon style game with a Marvel spin. The game allows the user to explore a larger tile-map where they can interact with other heroes and villains to collect rewards and use them in various ways. The user can battle other heroes for an opportunity to add that hero into their roster. The rewards they collect can contribute to leveling up their roster.
This project helped me demonstrate advanced Java concepts like Object-Oriented Programming and Graphic User Interface. The biggest challenge faced during the making of this game was the concept of having a tile map the user can explore. Using some examples online I was able to learn the basic concepts so I can recreate the same thing for my game.

Concepts:
- Two-Dimensional Arrays
- Object Oriented Programming
- Graphic User Interface
- Keyboard & Mouse Event Listeners
