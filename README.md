# Marvel-Battlegrounds
The Marvel Battlegrounds game is a Pok√©mon style game with a Marvel spin. The game allows the user to explore and interact with a large map filled with heroes and villains. The user can battle heroes for an opportunity to add that hero into their roster. The rewards they collect through battles can contribute to levelling up their roster. This project helped me demonstrate advanced Java concepts like Object-Oriented Programming and Graphic User Interface. The biggest challenge faced during the making of this game was creating a tilemap the user can explore. Using some examples online, I learned the basic concepts of tilemaps to create a tilemap for this game.

Concepts/Skills Applied:
- Two-Dimensional Arrays
- Object Oriented Programming
- Graphic User Interface
- Keyboard & Mouse Event Listeners
